# ENEL-300-RC-Car
This repository contains the design, development, and implementation of a remote-controlled car with metal detection and distance sensing for the ENEL 300 - Winter 2025 Course Project at the University of Calgary.
🚗 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to design and build a remote-controlled car capable of:

    Wireless Control: Designed and implemented using a custom-built controller.
    Metal Detection: Detecting copper sheets on the ground and triggering an audio alert.
    Distance Sensing: Measuring object distances up to 2m and displaying results.
    Autonomous Navigation: Competing in two circuit-based tasks, including object detection and a straight-line drive challenge.
    Custom Electronics & PCB Design: Using KiCad for PCB design and LTspice/QSPICE for circuit simulation.

🔧 Technical Requirements

    Microcontroller: AVR128DB28-I/SP
    Power Source: Battery-powered system
    Communication: RF-based wireless control
    Chassis: Custom 3D-printed design
    PCB Constraints: Max 10x10 cm, 2-layer design, fabricated via JLCPCB

📅 Development Timeline

The project follows an agile sprint-based development approach, including:

    Sprint 1: Team formation & project planning
    Sprint 2: PCB design & ordering
    Sprint 3: Distance sensing & metal detection circuit implementation
    Sprint 4: Mechanical assembly & integration
    Sprint 5: Remote control & final system testing

🏆 Final Competition

The car will be evaluated based on its ability to:
✅ Accurately measure object distances
✅ Detect metal and trigger alerts
✅ Complete a defined circuit while adhering to competition constraints
